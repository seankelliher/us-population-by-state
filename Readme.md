## Installation and Setup Instructions

This is a static component. All you need is a web browser. However, component uses ES6 modules. Developing locally may require disabling your browser's local file restrictions.

## Reflection

I wanted to build a component that displays US population growth using the last four Census counts (1980, 1990, 2000, 2010). I wanted to show growth state by state, in raw numbers as well as percentage change between Census counts. Challenges were customizing an existing SVG map to include state names - especially challenging in the Northeast where states are smaller - and ensuring data remained readable on smaller screen sizes.
